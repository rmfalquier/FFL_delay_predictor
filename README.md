# Free Flight Lab Weather-Related Departure Delay Predictor
## Project and Content Description
The goal of this project is to generate departure delay probability predictions given the weather at the scheduled time of departure for a given route in the context of regularly scheduled airline operations.

The notebooks and scripts provided in this project are designed to compile flight and weather data, preprocess it for machine learning, define a machine learning pipeline, and train the selected machine learning algorithm for a binary classification of a given passenger flight departure as either "on-time" or "delayed". 

## Dashboard
The project results were deployed on a streamlit app which can be accessed via: [ffl-delay-predictor.streamlit.app/](https://ffl-delay-predictor.streamlit.app/)

## Project status
This project was completed as a Minimum Viable Product / Proof of Concept and is no longer actively maintained. It is therefore open to forking or further development per the corresponding [MIT License and associated conditions](#license). Please refer to the [Feasibility & Roadmap section](#feasibility--roadmap) for recommended next steps.

## Data and Budget
### Sources
The following APIs were chosen for this project due to their reliability and widespread industry usage. As such, they reflect state-of-the-art sources for flight information that is publically available and commercializable, albeit not free of cost:

- **[flightradar24 API](https://fr24api.flightradar24.com/docs/endpoints)** was used to collect specific flight identifiers corresponding to real flights at specific timestamps within the chosen date range of analysis.
- **[FlightAware API](https://www.flightaware.com/aeroapi/portal/documentation#overview)** was used to query the delay information corresponding to the flight identifiers that were collected using flightradar24.
- **[AVWX API](https://avwx.docs.apiary.io/#)** was used to collect the actual meteorological conditions as reported by the departure airport METARs at the scheduled time of departure. The corresponding AVWX parsing engine was used to parse the METAR data ([GitHub repo here](https://github.com/avwx-rest/avwx-engine)) in combination with a natively developed dataframe compiler.
- **[OAG](https://www.oag.com)** compiles (some) freely available route data which we used as a reference for compiling the routes of interest in our dataset.

The deployment of these sources is described in the [usage section](#usage).

### Budget
The project was completed on-time and on-budget in the context of a Data Science Capston project for Constructor Academy (ZÃ¼rich) with the following resources:

- 2'000 CHF for APIs/data
- 480 development hours (3 data scientists, 4 full-time weeks)
- 5 support hours from our industry advisor
- 40 support hours from our technical advisors

## Usage
This section outlines the methodology that you should follow to reproduce our results. Although we point to our notebooks and scripts specifically, this section was compiled with the aim that our results be reproducible if the general methodology is followed, rather than if our specific notebooks and scripts are deployed.

**Note on ICAO vs. IATA codes:** where relevant and available, it is recommended that ICAO identifiers are used for aircraft types, operators, flight-identifiers etc. due to their property of being unique in each attribute context. 

### 1. Compiling Flight Routes
- a) Compile the ICAO codes for origin and destination airports of the target routes (*origin_ICAO-destination_ICAO*) in an iterable format for the target API request parameterization.
  - **NOTE:** It is at this step that you can inadvertently introduce bias e.g. by selecting routes that are chronically delayed or which have unusually high on-time performance relative to industry standards. A well diversified route-group is highly recommended if performing a general analysis vs. a route-specific analysis. 

**Reference(s):**
- Sample [dataset](example_data/routes_by_region_2024_v3.csv) and the [notebook](notebooks/FIN_1_routes_by_region.ipynb) used to compile route data from OAG sources

### 2. Gathering Flightradar24 Data
- a) Define the date range for which you want to extract flight information
- b) Define the parameters for the [Historic Flight Positions Full](https://fr24api.flightradar24.com/docs/endpoints/overview#historic-flight-positions-full) flightradar24 API endpoint:
  - i) *timestamp*: the endpoint requires a specific UNIX timestamp per query
  - ii) *routes*: iterate through the routes compiled in [step 1](#1-compiling-flight-routes) for flight ID extraction corresponding to these routes
  - ii) *categories*: we defined **'P'** to limit extraction to flight IDs for commercial aircraft that carry passengers as their primary purpose 
  - iv) *operating_as*: permits you to limit extraction to target operators as defined by their unique airline ICAO code **(optional)**
  - v) *limit*: limit the number of results per query (if necessary, based on your budget)
- c) Define the querying logic to extract target flight IDs that match your target analysis
  - e.g. we queried once per day per route over our defined date range and randomized the single daily timestamp over the 24 hour period corresponding to the query date. As passenger flights are regularly scheduled, often over the year, our intent in querying a different time each day was to maximize the number of different operators and flights over our target date range, while limiting our query to 1 return per day per route.

### 3. Gathering FlightAware Data 
- a) Compile the unique flight identifiers collected in [step 2](#2-gathering-flightradar24-data) into an iterable format
  - **Recommendation**: use the *callsign* attribute returned for each flight in your flightradar24 query
- b) Query the [get information for a historical flight](https://www.flightaware.com/aeroapi/portal/documentation#get-/history/flights/-ident-) FlightAware API endpoint using your unique flight identifiers

**Reference(s):**
- [FlightAware extraction notebook](notebooks/FIN_3_flightaware_data_extraction_by_FR24_callsign.ipynb)

### 4. Gathering AVWX Data
- a) Compile the ICAO codes and dates corresponding to the origin airports in the dataset you gathered in [step 3](#3-gathering-flightaware-data).
- b) Define the querying logic for the [Station History: Get Reporty by Station](https://avwxhistory.docs.apiary.io/#introduction/flight-path-routing) AVWX API endpoint.
  - e.g. we first queried based on the date, followed by the airport. This way we were able to save partial .csv files that contained only the METAR data for a given time frame.

**Reference(s):**
- [METAR extraction notebook](notebooks/FIN_4_Gathering_METAR_Data.ipynb)

### 5. Compiling the DataFrame
**Instructions:**
- a) Compile the METAR data collected in [step 4](#4-gathering-avwx-data).
- b) Prepare METAR data for Machine Learning by following the Notebooks.
It is also The model we used was trained on the actual weather conditions as reported by the airport-issued METAR at the scheduled time of departure. This was used in favor of the actual time of departure under the assumption that, if the weather caused the delay, it did so at the scheduled time of the departure, and not at the actual time of departure.

**Reference(s):**
- [METAR compilation notebook](notebooks/FIN_5_Cleaning_METAR_Data.ipynb)

**NOTE if you intend to use aviation weather forecasts (TAF) rather than reports (METAR):** although aviation weather forecasts (TAF) share key attributes with the aviation weather reports (METAR) we used in our methodology, you will need to adapt the dataframe compilation logic and code as the TAF formats are more variable and may not include all the same attributes.

### 6. Pre-Processing for Machine Learning
**Instructions:**
- a) Perform obvious cleaning such as dropping rows with missing values for attributes that are too risky to impute or which cannot otherwise be ignored.
- b) Create new features which could have predictive (tbc)
- c) Standardize your date/time fields, categorize
- d) Delay class definition and creation
- e) Drop repeated attributes
- f) Perform target leakage checks

## Observations, Feasibility & Roadmap
### Observations
- **The dataset we compiled inadvertently biases the algorithm to favor operational factors**
  - Running SHAP explainability algorithms on our predictions showed that the algorithm favors the features that match the input to a specific airport/route etc, even when these are absent in the training feature-set (i.e. weather only). As such, it is likely that our dataset's predictive signal has more to do with operators and airports, rather than weather input at scheduled time of departure. 
- **Delay prediction quality is better when ther are fewer operational variables in a route**
  - Although the aggregate prediction statistics for our algorithm are mid-range (F1-score in the 70% range), some routes showed predictive qualities as high as 90% and as low as 50%. Further exploration of route-specific results leads us to suggest that the development of operator-and-route-specific models may yield the levels of accuracy required for deployment in an airline Network Operations Center (NOC) context. 
- **Disruptive weather is less exciting than we thought**
  - Running the SHAP explainability algorithms on our predictions also showed that low meteorological visibility dominated the feature importance charts within the weather-feature subset of the algorithm input. This is likely due to the legal requirements that low visibility conditions impose on Air Traffic Control (ATC) for flight separation in LIFR conditions even in the absence of more notable disruptive weather events such as snow storms and icing conditions. 
- **Extreme aviation weather is rare and was ignored by our feature importance analysis tool**
  - Significant weather events (e.g. snow storms) were entirely absent in the feature importance charts despite the empirical evidence of how disruptive these events are to flight operations. This is likely because such events are relatively rare and short-lived in the context of 100'000+ flights a day, worldwide. Ensuring that such events are captured in the training dataset for an operator-and-route-specific model is therefore necessary to assess the feature importance related to these events, especially in routes that are more exposed to them. 

### Feasibility
Based on the [observations outlined above](#observations), the authors conclude that developing an operations-level prediction suite for weather-related delays is feasible. The authors therefore recommend the steps outlined in the [roadmap subsection below](#roadmap) as further work towards the definition of requirements for, and corresponding deployment of, a preliminary weather-related delay prediction suite design. 

### Roadmap
1. **Operator-and-Route-Specific Prediction Models** based on operator-and-route-specific data, would remove the variability that comes with the multiple operators and ground operations providers that are captured when aggregating routes from a single departure point, irrespective of operator. Developing such models would permit the calculation of a probability delay for a specific route within a single operational context. The predictions for each route can then be fed to the dynamic schedule/Gantt charts formats that are used for schedule planning in an airline's Network Operation Center (NOC).
2. **Weather Forecast vs. Report Comparison** is necessary in order to assess the quality of the key model input: the weather conditions forecasted at the scheduled time of departure. As the deployment of a prediction model in a real-world context would rely on aviation weather forecasts (TAFs), the assessment/characterization of historical TAF accuracy vs. actual METAR reported conditions for a given airport would be useful for dispatch decisions at an airline Network Operations Center (NOC) level.
3. **Quantified Delay Predictions** would give a more actionable output in the context of an airline Network Operations Center (NOC). Our model predicts a binary "on-time" or "delayed" classification; where a delay is defined as an actual gate-off time later than 15 minutes after the scheduled gate-off time (the industry standard). In this context, the prediciton makes no distinction between a 20 minute delay (which may have limited impact) and a 120 minute delay (which is presumably disruptive to an airline and its passengers). For simplicity, it is recommended that such a quantification be approached as a multi-class classification problem, rather than a full numerical regression problem. In such a case, the classification classes (e.g. minor delay, moderate delay, severe delay) should be defined in accordance to what is relevant to industry.  
4. **A Broader Dataset** that captures additional weather variables such as SIGMETs and winds-aloft would permit the expansion of this methodology from departure delay predictions, to arrival delay predictions.
